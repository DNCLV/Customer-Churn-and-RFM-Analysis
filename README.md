In this analysis, we'll delve into customer understanding by using segmentation, RFM analysis, and Churn Rate to shed light on their position in the churn process within the dataset.



Key Highlights:



Consistent Churning: Curiously, the Churn Rate remains remarkably consistent at approximately 20% across all Age Groups and Product Categories. This consistency raises concerns about the company's operational setup, as it suggests that roughly one in every five customers churns, regardless of age group or product category.
Similar to Age Groups and Product Categories, the monthly Churn Rate consistently hovers near 20%.

Overall Churn Rate: The analysis reveals an organization-wide churn rate of 20.03%, underlining the urgency of understanding and mitigating this attrition trend.

Gender Equality in Churn: Interestingly, gender appears to exert little influence on churn, as both male and female customers exhibit nearly identical attrition rates. This gender-neutral churn pattern prompts to investigate other potential drivers.

The Correlation in RFM: Customers with low monetary value show a significant uptick in recency and frequency, while their high-value counterparts exhibit a pattern with lower frequency and recency.


The Churning: The Segmentation-to-Category Treemap reveals an interesting distribution: Low-Value and Mid-Value segments outnumber the High-Value segment, with a higher customer count in the former two. This highlights an opportunity for attention in the lower segments, where customers are at risk of churning or have remained inactive for extended periods. Additionally, the Mid-Value segment presents a pool of promising customers, primed for attention to nudge them towards becoming loyal High-Value customers.




These insights provide a valuable starting point for further investigation and action. It's essential to delve deeper into the specific reasons behind churn within the identified age groups and explore strategies to retain customers in those segments.
Additionally, understanding why certain product categories perform better in terms of churn can help tailor marketing and customer service efforts to improve retention across all categories.

Factors such as customer feedback, Net Promoter Score (NPS), cost analysis (comparing Customer Acquisition Cost to Customer Lifetime Value), and cohort analysis can provide a comprehensive understanding of why customers leave and how to retain them effectively.

Nevertheless, due to insufficient data in the datasets, conducting these types of analyses remains unsupported, making it challenging to formulate a conclusive strategy for customer retention.
