# Customer-Churn-and-RFM-Analysis

In this analysis, the attention is turned towards customer segmentation, RFM analysis, and Churn Rate to increase the understanding of customer dynamics in the dataset.

Key Highlights:

Age Groups at Risk: We've pinpointed two critical age groups, 19-39 and 40-59, experiencing the highest churn rates, both teetering at approximately 37%. This discovery shines a spotlight on the need to tailor retention efforts to these demographics. What drives this significant churn in these age brackets?

Product Category Paradox: Surprisingly, the Home and Electronics product categories, while enjoying the lowest churn rates, also have the fewest customers. This intriguing paradox beckons further exploration into the relationship between product category and customer loyalty.

Overall Churn Rate: Our comprehensive analysis reveals an organization-wide churn rate of 20.03%, underlining the urgency of understanding and mitigating this attrition trend. This insight is the impetus for our data-driven strategies.

Gender Equality in Churn: Interestingly, gender appears to exert little influence on churn, as both male and female customers exhibit nearly identical attrition rates. This gender-neutral churn pattern prompts us to investigate other potential drivers.

The Correlation in RFM: Ccustomers with low monetary value show a significant uptick in recency and frequency, while their high-value counterparts exhibit a pattern with lower frequency and recency.

Where focus must lie: The Segmentation-to-Category Treemap reveals an interesting distribution: Low-Value and Mid-Value segments outnumber the High-Value segment, with a higher customer count in the former two. This highlights an opportunity for attention in the lower segments, where customers are at risk of churning or have remained inactive for extended periods. Additionally, the Mid-Value segment presents a pool of promising customers, primed for a gentle push towards becoming loyal High-Value customers.
 

These insights provide a valuable starting point for further investigation and action. It's essential to delve deeper into the specific reasons behind churn within the identified age groups and explore strategies to retain customers in those segments.
Additionally, understanding why certain product categories perform better in terms of churn can help tailor marketing and customer service efforts to improve retention across all categories. Finally, while gender seems to have little impact on churn, continued monitoring and analysis can uncover more nuanced patterns and opportunities for improvement.
